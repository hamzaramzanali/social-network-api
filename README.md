# Social Network API

## Description 

The Social Network API is an app that allows users to interact with their friends. Users can create themselves by adding their email and username. Once this is done, an user can add a friend by targetting their ID. The user can delete that person if they would like as well. The user can also create thoughts to share with their friends. The user can update their thoughts, as well as their username. If the user would no longer wish to have their account, they can delete their profile as well. The user can also delete their thoughts as well. Once the user has posted their thoughts, they can also add reactions to other thoughts posted by others. They will also be able to delete their reactions if they wish to do. This app can be installed by downloading the file to their computer. Once installed, the user should type "node index.js" on the command line to start the application's server. From there, they can go to insomnia and create as many users, thoughts, friends, and reactions as they would like. A walk through Video is presented below that shows how to use the app in more detail.
